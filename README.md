# Terraform AWS Serverless Web Application

A Terraform project that provisions a fully serverless web application on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how multiple AWS services can be integrated into a scalable serverless application using Terraform.

The application hosts a static frontend in Amazon S3, delivers content globally through Amazon CloudFront, exposes backend functionality using Amazon API Gateway, processes requests with AWS Lambda, and stores application data in Amazon DynamoDB.

The project showcases serverless architecture design, cloud integration, and Infrastructure as Code best practices.

## Architecture

The diagram below illustrates the overall serverless web application architecture provisioned with Terraform.

## Deployment Notes

This project was developed as part of my hands-on cloud engineering portfolio using Terraform and AWS.

The infrastructure was successfully deployed and tested in a cloud training environment during my AWS training at AmaliTech Ghana. As the training lab environments were temporary, the deployed resources were terminated after the lab sessions expired.

The Terraform configuration has been validated locally and is deployment-ready. It can be provisioned in any AWS account with valid credentials by running:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
